Synthesize Functions
Based on the lecture examples, you've probably synthesized the functionality of your handler functions into generalized versions: handleRadioChange and handleCheckboxChange should handle most, if not all, of the questions above.

If you did not create these generalized functions, now is your opportunity. Create four general functions for each of the input types we've learned so far: handleTextChange, handleSelect, handleRadioChange, and handleCheckboxChange. Refactor your JSX to take advantage of these new flexible function types.
